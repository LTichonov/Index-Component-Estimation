    "We can see that for whatever reason yfinance significantly understates the float shares for BRK-B, at only 1M outstanding shares (less than 1% of shares outstanding) which is obviously not the true number of float shares. A quick check online reveals this number should indeed be much higher. This raises the concern that yfinance ticker info, while it provides meaningful and accuracte data most of the time, is not a reliable source of float share data. In the case of BRK.B, this mistake causes our code to estimate a weight of <0.1%, as opposed to the desired ~1.5%. The size of this discrepancy highlights the need for a more reliable source of FMC data. \n",

Below we can see that the SPY ETF tracks the SNP 500 perfectly, and the closeness of their weights to our FMC estimates (even with limited data) makes it reasonable to assume their holdings are reflective of the index."
