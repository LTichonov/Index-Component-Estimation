The Notebooks in this repo follow a set of experiments in which I try to find estimates of SNP constituent weights, consistent with the estimates that ETFs use. These experiments are of varying success, but all are attached.

Note: I am aware that the outputs of the notebooks are not collapsable in the previews, making the notebooks quite inconvenient to scroll through. If anyone knows a fix for this, do reach out.
